# My Competitive Programming Corner

# Description
This summer, I spent 75 hours coding solutions to ~150 competitive programming problems! In my Competitive Programming Corner, I will share some insights into my journey and provide my solutions in the Nook, which is a fun code playground! I believe that anyone can become a competitive programmer and that the best way to learn is to program yourself and to review other people's solutions. Here, I showcase a FREE and opensource collection of my solutions to a plethora of problems in an interactive manner. Be INSPIRED, be MOTIVATED, and find your GUIDING SPARK! I hope I encouraged you to try at least one competitive programming problem!

# My Goal
I aim to inspire at least one person to try out competitive programming, even if you only want to attempt one simple problem!
