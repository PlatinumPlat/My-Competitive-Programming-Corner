                <div class="text">
                    <p class="big">Competitive programming requires logic, problem-solving, and knowledge of data
                        structures to code solutions to a wide range of problems.</p>

                    <p class="big">The common languages used in competitive programming are Python, Java, and C++, of

                    <h2>Problem Structure</h2>
                    <p class="big">A typical competitive programming problem consists of three parts:</p>
                    <div class="popsmall">the problem statement,</div>
                    <p></p>
                    <div class="popsmall">input and output specification,</div>
                    <p></p>
                    <div class="popsmall">and sample cases.</div>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p class="big">Here is an example of a simple addition question derived from A Plus B on DMOJ.</p>
                    <p class="big"><br>
                        The problem description:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        Tudor is sitting in math class, on his laptop. Clearly, he is not paying attention in this
                        situation. However, he gets
                        called on by his math teacher to do some problems. Since his math teacher did not expect much
                        from Tudor, he only needs
                        to do some simple addition problems. However, simple for you and I may not be simple for Tudor,
                        so please help him!
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">
                        To understand the task required, you must thoroughly peruse (read) the problem description as if
                        you misread the
                        statement, no amount of careful programming will result in an accepted solution.
                        <br>
                        Here is the input specification of A plus B:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        The first line will contain an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000), the number of addition problems
                        Tudor needs to do. The next N lines will each contain two space-separated integers whose
                        absolute value is less than 1 000 000 000, the two integers Tudor needs to add.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the output specification of A plus B:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        Output N lines of one integer each, the solutions to the addition problems in order.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">
                        If you are using java or c++ where data types are subjective, pay attention to the restraints as
                        otherwise, you may
                        encounter Integer overflow (an error where an Integer is too large for the data type and should
                        be stored into a Long
                        data type instead).
                        <br>
                        Finally, we have the sample cases:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        Sample Input<br>
                        2<br>
                        1 1<br>
                        -1 0<br>
                        <br>
                        Sample Output<br>
                        2<br>
                        -1<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Normally, there will be at least one example that explains the input case, the correct output
                        case, and the solution.
                    </p>

                <p>

                <div class="text">
                    <h2>Hints</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        As you progress into the more difficult areas of competitive programming, you may find yourself
                        stuck on a problem for
                        hours at a time. However, if you ever need a hint, you may first discover the problem type,
                        which alludes to the nature
                        of the solution required.
                        <br>
                        For example, for the question A plus B above, the problem type is Simple Math.
                        <br>
                        Afterwards, you may also take a look at the editorial, which describes the essence of the
                        solution.

                        <strong>Important!</strong>
                        <br>
                        The editorial does not display the solution code for the question, so you will still have to
                        complete the implementation
                        yourself.

                        <strong>Warning!</strong>
                        <br>
                        Not every problem has an editorial. Regardless, you should endeavour to solve the problem
                        without the editorial for at
                        least an hour to develop your competitive programming abilities.

                    <h2>Connection to Math</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        The competitive programming problem types fall into these following categories: data structures,
                        sorting and searching,
                        dynamic programming, graph theory, greedy algorithms, backtracking and recursion, string
                        algorithms and Math.
                        <br><br>
                        Most programming problems require some experience in Math; particularly contest Math; as it
                        educates you on essential
                        problem solving strategies. For example, the typical method for determining if a given positive
                        integer is prime is
                        testing division of all the numbers from 1 to that number. However, knowledge of contest math
                        strategies would help you
                        solve the question more efficiently to satisfy the time restraints as an alternative solution
                        involves Eratosthenes’
                        Sieve.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, some seemingly difficult problems such as TWO KNIGHTS (CSES) turn out to be Math
                        questions which can be solved
                        by determining the correct algebraic formula.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <div class="text">
                    <h2>Essential Factors for Success</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        Competitive programming has an emphasis on efficiency, simplicity, and accuracy. By learning
                        more about different data
                        structures, algorithms, and logic operations, you will be able to code faster solutions that do
                        not require extensive
                        code.
                        <br><br>
                        A rule of thumb is that if you have more than 3 nested for loops, your solution is definitely
                        not the intended solution,
                        is probably incorrect, and will not pass the time limit. In addition, as encouraged for learning
                        in general, you should
                        be able to easily explain your solution to someone else if it is concise and properly
                        structured.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, competitive programming is the type of skill that you improve at if you regularly
                        practice by compeleting more problems to test your knowledge of data structures, methods, and
                        algorithms.
