                    <p class="big">Competitive programming requires logic, problem-solving, and knowledge of data

                    <h2>Problem Structure</h2>
                    <p class="big">A typical competitive programming problem consists of three parts:</p>
                    <div class="popsmall">the problem statement,</div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="big">Here is an example of a simple addition question derived from A Plus B on DMOJ.</p>
                    <p class="big"><br>
                        The problem description:

                    <p class="sample">
                        Tudor is sitting in math class, on his laptop. Clearly, he is not paying attention in this
                        situation. However, he gets
                        called on by his math teacher to do some problems. Since his math teacher did not expect much
                        from Tudor, he only needs
                        to do some simple addition problems. However, simple for you and I may not be simple for Tudor,
                        so please help him!
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">
                        To understand the task required, you must thoroughly peruse (read) the problem description as if
                        you misread the
                        statement, no amount of careful programming will result in an accepted solution.
                        <br>
                        Here is the input specification of A plus B:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        The first line will contain an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000), the number of addition problems
                        Tudor needs to do. The next N lines will each contain two space-separated integers whose
                        absolute value is less than 1 000 000 000, the two integers Tudor needs to add.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the output specification of A plus B:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        Output N lines of one integer each, the solutions to the addition problems in order.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">
                        If you are using java or c++ where data types are subjective, pay attention to the restraints as
                        otherwise, you may
                        encounter Integer overflow (an error where an Integer is too large for the data type and should
                        be stored into a Long
                        data type instead).
                        <br>
                        Finally, we have the sample cases:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sample">
                        Sample Input<br>
                        2<br>
                        1 1<br>
                        -1 0<br>
                        <br>
                        Sample Output<br>
                        2<br>
                        -1<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Normally, there will be at least one example that explains the input case, the correct output
                        case, and the solution.

                    <h2>Hints</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        As you progress into the more difficult areas of competitive programming, you may find yourself
                        stuck on a problem for
                        hours at a time. However, if you ever need a hint, you may first discover the problem type,
                        which alludes to the nature
                        of the solution required.
                        <br>
                        For example, for the question A plus B above, the problem type is Simple Math.
                        <br>
                        Afterwards, you may also take a look at the editorial, which describes the essence of the
                        solution.

                        <strong>Important!</strong>
                        <br>
                        The editorial does not display the solution code for the question, so you will still have to
                        complete the implementation
                        yourself.

                        <br>
                        Not every problem has an editorial. Regardless, you should endeavour to solve the problem
                        without the editorial for at
                        least an hour to develop your competitive programming abilities.

                    <h2>Connection to Math</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        The competitive programming problem types fall into these following categories: data structures,
                        sorting and searching,
                        dynamic programming, graph theory, greedy algorithms, backtracking and recursion, string
                        algorithms and Math.
                        <br><br>
                        Most programming problems require some experience in Math; particularly contest Math; as it
                        educates you on essential
                        problem solving strategies. For example, the typical method for determining if a given positive
                        integer is prime is
                        testing division of all the numbers from 1 to that number. However, knowledge of contest math
                        strategies would help you
                        solve the question more efficiently to satisfy the time restraints as an alternative solution
                        involves Eratosthenes’
                        Sieve.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, some seemingly difficult problems such as TWO KNIGHTS (CSES) turn out to be Math
                        questions which can be solved
                        by determining the correct algebraic formula.

                <p>
                    <br>

                <div class="text">
                    <h2>Essential Factors for Success</h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        Competitive programming has an emphasis on efficiency, simplicity, and accuracy. By learning
                        more about different data
                        structures, algorithms, and logic operations, you will be able to code faster solutions that do
                        not require extensive
                        code.
                        <br><br>
                        A rule of thumb is that if you have more than 3 nested for loops, your solution is definitely
                        not the intended solution,
                        is probably incorrect, and will not pass the time limit. In addition, as encouraged for learning
                        in general, you should
                        be able to easily explain your solution to someone else if it is concise and properly
                        structured.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, competitive programming is the type of skill that you improve at if you regularly
                        practice by compeleting more problems to test your knowledge of data structures, methods, and
                        algorithms.

                <div class="text">
                    <p class="big">
                        My competitive programming journey began in grade 4 and since then, I have progressed from Python to Java and learned a
                        variety of algorithms which allow me to solve problems with difficulty levels of up to CCC Senior P3.
                        <br><br>
                        Although I have been solving competitive programming problems for 4 years now, I only began to seriously practice for
                        the CCC and related competitions for the last half of the year. During these previous 6 months, I elevated my knowledge
                        of data structures and related manipulations, dynamic programming, and graph theory. Currently, the most difficult
                        problem that I have solved was a 10 pointer, which correlates to CCC Junior P5.

                    <h2>
                        Lessons I Acquired Over the Years
                    </h2>
                    <p class="big">
                        To anyone attempting to excel at competitive programming competitions, my first advice is to practice a variety of
                        problems often. Every time you complete a new question, you sharpen your skills a little bit by using a new concept,
                        reviewing previous concepts, or discovering a new technique.
                        <br><br>
                        My second advice is to review other users’s solutions as especially if you are practicing on your own without any
                        external guidance, viewing faster code and analyzing WHY they are more efficient or concise than yours will help you
                        improve your skills and also reveal some common tricks competitive programmers use to keep their code adequately
                        simplistic.
                        <br><br>
                        My final tip is to consistently practice competitive programming problems instead of suddenly grinding 10 problems in
                        one day each week, spread out by working on a set amount of problems every week with a certain amount of time allocated
                        each day. If you complete a bulk of problems in a short amount of time and then wait for a long time before your next
                        work period, you risk forgetting what you learned and may develop a dislike for programming as you dedicate an entire
                        day for it each week and lack variety in your workload.

                        The Don Mills Open Judge is my favourite resource to use as it has a huge library of problems from national competitions
                        such as the CCC, local school competitions, and challenging questions created by community users. In addition, DMOJ was
                        created by Canadian high school students and many Canadian competitive programmers (even members of the international
                        team) use it to practice. I also like the interface as it is quite simple to use and detailed at the same time as it
                        allows users to view other people’s accepted solutions and see problem statistics.

                        USACO is also a notable resource which I often use to practice problems. Their website showcases the problem archive
                        from their monthly competitions which have 4 levels of difficulty (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum). However, USACO
                        does not provide many community features such as commenting and viewing each other’s solutions.

                    <p class="big">
                        VJudge takes its problems from a variety of sources, including DMOJ, USACO, CSES, and CodeForces. If you like having all
                        your sources in a central library, vJudge is definitely a suitable platform for you! Personally, I do not like VJudge’s
                        platform; however, I encourage you to try the application out for yourself before making any judgments.

                    <p class="big">
                        I do not use CSES regularly; however, it contains a library of very generic problems categorized into topics such as
                        dynamic programming. In fact, it contains many problem templates for problem creators to develop their questions on.

                        Although I do not use CodeForces often, I do know that it has a large amount of problems and hosts weekly timed contests
                        every Saturday. It is definitely a suitable option for a problem resource!

                        Written by Antti Laaksonen, the Competitive Programmer’s Handbook is a thorough guide on competitive programming algorithms and
                        concepts which will definitely prove to be a useful resource when you reach more difficult areas of competitive
